    <h1>HTML and CSS: An Overview</h1>

    <h2 class="header">HTML</h2>
    <p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is an XML-based language that provides the structure of a web page by “marking up” the content with tags. These tags label<br>
    elements in the page as headings, paragraphs, images, lists and many other types that add structure to content. The HTML standard has undergone several revisions <br>
    since the first one was released (and is constantly being updated and extended) – the language we will look at in these workshopsis HTML 5, released in 2014.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="important" id="DruhyOdsek">
    <h2 class="header">CSS</h2>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language used to describe the presentation of XML-based documents, most often used for HTML pages. This can include visual <br>
    properties like layout, colour and fonts, different layouts for different screen sizes and types, and the presentation of pages in different media (for example, <br>
    text-to-speech). Each version of CSS has been built on the previous version – we will look at CSS 3. HTML is used for content. CSS is used for presentation. <br>
    In a perfect world, our HTML pages convey document structure and meaning while our visual design is defined entirely by CSS.</p>

    Why?
    <ul class="important" type = "square">
        <li>Visual accessibility – users can load their own stylesheets</li>
        <li>Flexibility – responsive design</li>
        <li>Reusability – external stylesheets</li>
        <li>Can you think of other reasons? (Hint: look up “separation of presentation and content”!)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Coding in HTML and CSS probably isn’t “computer programming” as you traditionally think of it, but it can be a complex and rewarding pursuit that adds <br>
    an extra layer to your backend development – as well as incredibly frustrating when you’re trying to get every element to sit perfectly in place!</p>

    <h2 class="header">JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
    JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language commonly used for web development to add interactivity, dynamic content, and behavior to websites.<br>
    It is executed on the client side, which means it runs directly in a web browser, allowing developers to create interactive user interfaces and responsive web <br>
    applications. JavaScript is known for its wide range of libraries and frameworks, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, which simplify web development and enable <br>
    the creation of modern, feature-rich web applications.
