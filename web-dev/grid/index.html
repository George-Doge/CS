            <img src="img/web 1.jpeg">
            <p>Web 1.0 was the first generation of the World Wide Web, characterized by static, read-only websites. 
            Users could view and consume information, but they could not interact with it or create their own content. 
            Web 1.0 websites were typically built using HTML and basic scripting languages, and they were hosted on personal computers or small servers. 
            Examples of Web 1.0 websites include personal homepages, news websites, and online encyclopedias.</p>          </div>

            <h1>Web 2.0</h1>
            <img src="img/web 2.jpeg">
            <p>Web 2.0 was the second generation of the World Wide Web, characterized by user-generated content, social media, and interactive websites. 
            Web 2.0 websites allowed users to not only consume information but also create and share their own content. This shift was made possible by the development 
            of new technologies, such as JavaScript, AJAX, and social networking platforms. Web 2.0 websites are typically hosted on large-scale cloud computing platforms. 
            Examples of Web 2.0 websites include social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, blogging platforms like WordPress and Blogger, and online marketplaces 
            like Amazon and eBay.</p>          </div>

            <h1>Web 3.0</h1>
            <img src="img/web 3.jpeg">
            <p>Web 3.0, also known as the semantic web, is the third generation of the World Wide Web, characterized by machine-readable data and artificial intelligence. 
            Web 3.0 aims to make the web more intelligent and accessible by enabling machines to understand and process the information on the web. This will allow for more 
            personalized and relevant experiences for users. Web 3.0 is still in its early stages of development, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact 
            with the web. Examples of Web 3.0 technologies include blockchain, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.</p>         </div>
