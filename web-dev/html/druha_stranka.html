        <h1>The Internet Protocols</h1>
        <ol type = "A" reversed>
            <li>TCP - The Transmission Control Protocol</li>
            <li>UDP - The User Datagram Protocol</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>The Transmission Control Protocol</h2>
        <p>
        Once your computer connects to the host server, the server follows transmission control protocol. Devices use TCP when all the requested information needs to be transferred.
        </p>
        <ins>For example:</ins>
        <ul>
            <li>website</li>
            <li>picture</li>
            <li>video</li>
        </ul>
    <br>
        <b><i>Process:</i></b>
        <ol>
            <li>the client computer sends request to connect to the server</li>
            <li>server accepts the request</li>
            <li>the client requests specific packets</li>
            <li>the server sends all the requested packets</li>
            <li>the client checks whether all the requested packets were delivered</li>
            <li>if they weren't delivered, the client requests those sepcific packets again</li>
            <li>after all the packets were sent and received, the connection is closed</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>The User Datagram Protocol</h2>
        <p>User datagram protocol is another way to transfer information. It focuses more on speed than on getting every packet to the final destination.
        This protocol is used when speed is more important tahn getting all the requested information.</p> 
        For example:
        <ul type = "square">
            <li>video conferencing</li>
            <li>online games</li>
            <li>media streaming</li>
        </ul>
