    <h1>Computer Game stores</h1>
    <p>Since I like PC games I've decided to make a small project about online stores where to buy them.</p>

    Sometimes it can be hard to decidede which store is the best choice.

    <h3>So, where to buy games?</h3>
    <p><ins>Here is a table of 4 online stores I recommend and use:</ins></p>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/" target="_blank">Steam</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/" target="_blank">Humble Bundle</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.gog.com/" target="_blank">GOG.com</a></li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Steam</h4>
    <p>Steam is one of the largest and most popular platforms for PC gaming developed by Valve. It offers a vast library of games.<br>
    I enjoy their services like social networking, easy multiplayer gaming and lastly, support user-generated content and mods.<br>
    Every summer and winter, <i>and during other special occasions</i>, there are big sales, where everyone can get their games for a fair price.<br></p>

    <h4>Epic Games Store</h4>
    <p>Epic Games Store is the biggest competetor for Steam. Lately it's been getting <ins>exclusive game relases</ins> in order to attract people from Steam.<br>
    All in all it is similar to Steam, but it lacks Steam Workshop (a place for community made mods) and Community places. However, the <br>
    biggest difference is that Epic <b>gives away free games every week</b>! They are mostly small games, but during Christmas they give away big titles.</p>

      style="width: 500px; float: right;"></a>
    
    <h4>Humble Bundle</h4>
    <p>Humble Bundle offers a wide range of video games, software, and digital content at discounted prices. I enjoy their well-known pay-what-you-want<br>
    bundles, where you can choose how much to pay and give a portion of your purchase to charities. Simply said, you can <b><ins>legaly</ins> get cheaply</b> games<br>
    and help some charity! Humble Bundle also operates a subscription service called <q>Humble Choice</q>, providing access to a selection of games <br>
    each month for a subscription fee. However, you can only buy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_key" target="_blank"> retail keys</a> there.

    <h4>GOG.com</h4>
    <p>CD Projekt red created GOG to distribute old games, which weren't sold on Steam or other stores. <i>Hence their original name-<abbr title="Good old Games">GOG</abbr>.</i><br>
    It is a good choice if you want to try out retro games, but nowadays they offers new titles. They have developed GOG Galaxy <br>
    a game launcher where you can login through different game stores and launch/download games, without need for multiple launchers.</p>
