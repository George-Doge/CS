            <h2>Portal 2</h2>
            <p class="indexChapterParagraph">
              Portal 2 is a critically acclaimed puzzle-platform game developed by Valve. You take on the role of Chell, a test subject navigating through the Aperture Science Enrichment Center.
              You need to survive a seemingly impossible test created by a crazy AI called GLaDOS with a portal gun and your wit. With its mind-bending puzzles, witty humour, and engaging narrative, 
              Portal 2 challenges you to think creatively and master the art of portal-based traversal in a series of increasingly complex test chambers. What's more, the game offers co-op multiplayer and it 
              has a great range of community-made spin-offs! This game (and its fan-made spin-offs) is my favourite puzzle game because, unlike other puzzle games I have seen, Portal 2 offers semi-real settings
              and memorable locations of Aperture Science. The only thing I don't like is just lack of official sequels.

            <h2>Phasmophobia</h2>
            <p class="indexChapterParagraph">
              Phasmophobia is a unique indie multiplayer horror game that challenges you to investigate haunted locations as a paranormal investigators. With its immersive atmosphere and innovative 
              ghost-hunting mechanics, Phasmophobia delivers tense and adrenaline-pumping experiences as you and your friends work together to uncover the identity of ghosts roaming different locations. 
              This game is mainly worth it with a good group of friends. When you are together the game is not that scary, and you'll even have some comedic moments. There are weekly challenges to spice 
              things up, and there is always something to learn. The developers are constantly listening to players' feedback and interacting with their community to improve the game.

            <h2>Frostpunk</h2>
            <p class="indexChapterParagraph">
              Frostpunk is a city-building survival game set in a frozen post-apocalyptic world developed by 11 bit studios, known for another dim game This War of Mine. In Frostpunk players take the role of 
              Captain of the possibly last city on Earth after our planet froze down. You must manage resources, make difficult decisions, and ensure the survival of your citizens in the face of harsh weather 
              conditions and societal challenges. With its compelling narrative and challenging gameplay, Frostpunk offers a unique and thought-provoking experience that will test your leadership skills and moral 
              compass. This game is not easy. It will bombard you with different problems from all sides and at all times. It is only up to you to lead the way and set the course of your people. Every choice and
              every decision has consequences, the only question is if you want to pay the price. There is only one motto to guide you: <q><em>The City must survive!</em></q>

            <h2>Cyberpunk 2077</h2>
            <p class="indexChapterParagraph">
              Cyberpunk 2077 is a cyberpunk-genre action RPG set in the futuristic metropolis of Night City. It was created by CD Projekt Red (the studio behind The Witcher games) and inspired by a tabletop
              RPG called <em>Cyberpunk 2020</em>. In this digital adaptation, you assume the role of V, a mercenary outlaw, as you navigate the dangerous underworld of cyberpunk society filled with corporate greed. 
              In Cyberpunk everything is up to you. Every decision, however minor is up here for you and the world awaits your journey to become the biggest mercenary. Or not if you choose to. Cyberpunk offers
              a rich world of the future, where people augment themselves with cybernetics and corporations which control the world. Aside from the gameplay, this game had a rough start. It was buggy and messy
              and it didn't perform well, but CD Projekt Red didn't give up and, poetically said, from ashes rose Phoenix. With the aforementioned details, the game offers a great performance of <em>Keanu Reeves</em>
              as a rocker Johnny Silverhand and the game itself makes you think of the contemporary world as well.

            <h2>Stellaris</h2>
            <p class="indexChapterParagraph">
              Stellaris is a 4X grand strategy set in space, where you build and expand your galactic empire. With its deep strategic gameplay, complex diplomacy, and vast customization options, Stellaris offers 
              the opportunity to explore the mysteries of the universe, encounter alien civilizations, and shape the destiny of your empire. It offers a multitude of choices on how to create and lead your empire. 
              You can play as a technocrat, not paying attention to galactical politics, try to cooperate with other empires as a peaceful alien-loving empire or try to unify every empire under your rule. Despite
               all the scary talks about galactical conquest and politics, there are many references and tropes known to sci-fi fans. Do you want to terraform a planet? Yes, you can. Do you want to build a 
               planet-destroying station ala Death Star? Go ahead! Do you want to genetically modify your species, fight AI uprising, or just gaze at mesmerizing black holes or neutron stars? Stellaris has it all.

            <h2>Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun</h2>
            <p class="indexChapterParagraph">
              Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun is a tactical stealth game set in feudal Japan. You command an unlikely team in the services of Shogun. Each of your team members has different abilities necessary 
              for a successful and stealthy mission. There isn't one correct way to solve each level, so you can use your creativity too. With its challenging stealth gameplay, strategic depth, and beautiful art
              style, Shadow Tactics offers a thrilling and immersive experience that will test your tactical thinking. Lastly, people nostalgic for the old <em>Commandos</em> series will find this a fine spiritual 
              successor. If you favour Wild West, you can try another game from this studio, called <em>Desperados 3</em>.
